The average density difference between Cassandra and GROMACS is 13.474727017918681 kg/m^3
The minimum density difference between Cassandra and GROMACS is 1.8885532337344557 kg/m^3
The maximum density difference between Cassandra and GROMACS is 35.77520319097653 kg/m^3

There are: 8061 viable parameter sets which are within 25 kg/m$^2$ of GROMACS liquid densities
A total of 161 pareto efficient points were found.
After removing similar points, we are left with 25 pareto efficient points.
